## The suckless philosophy

The [suckless](http://suckless.org) community is a group of developers dedicated to writing software that sucks less.

Any developer who may share that goal should read their [philosophy](http://suckless.org/philosophy).

Here is a taster:

>We are the home of quality software such as dwm, dmenu, st and plenty of other tools, with a focus on simplicity, clarity and frugality. Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. Unfortunately, the tendency for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry. We intend to prove the opposite with our software projects.

These would just be words if it wasn't for the amazing software they produce.<br/>
It includes:

- [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org), a dynamic window manager
- [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu), a dynamic menu
- [st](http://st.suckless.org), a simple terminal implementation
- [slock](http://tools.suckless.org/slock), a screenlocker
- [surf](http://surf.suckless.org), a web browser
- [tabbed](http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed), a simple generic tabbed frontend

Each one of these projects is written in no more than a few thousands of lines of C code.
Each one of them **works**.

One may think the suckless developers cannot possibly provide software that satisfies everyone's requirements with these self-imposed constraints.<br/>
Here is the beauty of it: the code is so simple and frugal that anyone can extend it to include the features they need. In the spirit of open-source code, developers are then invited to contribute their modifications in the form of patches for use by the other members of the community.

With a few hours of customization, the suckless tools can morphe from a perfectly usable system to the system that best meets your individual needs.

Go on, now. Go read the [suckless philosophy](http://suckless.org/philosophy)!
